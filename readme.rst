D-Tekun Parcel Management System
###################


D’Tekun Parcel Management System is a parcel management and tracking web application developed for D'Tekun Parcel Hub to ease the process of managing incoming and outgoing parcels, for residents from Desasiswa Restu, Tekun and Saujana in Universiti Sains Malaysia. Our client for this system is Mr. Kang Khai Sian, a final-year student who is the head manager of D'Tekun Parcel Hub at USM. 

The idea of developing this web application came into view as the management team of D'Tekun Parcel Hub have been utilising a manual system since the beginning to record all the parcel’s information. This situation can be quite difficult to track each parcel on a daily basis as sometimes it can go unnoticed by the staff when the parcel has been delivered. It also takes up a lot of time as they need to manually key in all the data into the system which has to be stored in a new spreadsheet every day.

On top of that, this situation would be difficult for them to manage a load of data especially for the finance department that handles the closing everyday. Therefore, one of our objectives through this project is to develop an interactive web application that helps our client and his team to record and store all parcel’s information into the system more efficiently through an automated system. From there, users can search for the parcel more easily to view the status, verify the parcel status, and generate daily finance receipts.
